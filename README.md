## CONNECT4 Game
This game was created as an assignment for a university project and we decided to post it online after we finished it.

We are using node.js and express for the backend and vanilla js for the front end.

For deploying the app we are using heroku and the url where the game lives is currently at https://connect4-fun-game.herokuapp.com/.
